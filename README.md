Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Evaluate the potential fundraising cabailities for _Fever_ based on launch date and goal to aide in Louise's success in bringing her project into reality.
### Purpose
Review data over the previous years from Kickstarter to determine the most likely options that will bring Louise to her goal.
## Analysis and Challenges
The most successful campaigns begin in May and June with a goal of <$1000 with a general trend down in successful percentage as the goal increases.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May and June offer the best chance of success with July being next. Summer months generally have the best chance of success with those months over the holiday season being the least chance of success.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Not surprisingly, the lower the goal the higher chance of succsess. After the $1000 marke there is a general trend down with a slight uptick at the $35000-$45000 range.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge with this project is familiarizing myself with Excel tools I have not previously used (pivot tables specifically). That being said, it was fairly straightforward and rewarding as I have already used the pivot table skills learned to make my job related work more efficient.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Summer months are ideal for fundraising. December and the surrounding months are least likely to be successful.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The lower the goal the more likely it is to be successful.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Data can be filtered by country but analysis becomes more and more limited as you filter. Thus, overall results may not correlate to a particular region or demographic.
There are fewer projects with higher goals so the data may not represent a higher goal outcome likelihood well. 
_Another limitation with the plays filter is that the numbers are greatly reduced. This may lead to unclear or an incomplete picture of the potential fundraising ability._
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Filter by country to match Louise's location.
